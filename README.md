# stateless
A library which is not recognized as citizen of any infrastructure.

# Characteristic features:

* typeclass-based
* Algebra-based optics
* More abstracted, van laarhoven-like optics (based on natural transformations)
* ...

# List of advantages

## Shared with other optics libraries

* Modularity: Lens, Map, ...
* ...

## Over other optics libraries

* Heterogeneous deployments (P[_] and Q[_])
* Cofree-coalgebras
* Compatibility with arbitrary stateful approaches: monocle, slick, Web services, actors, ...
* Akin to an object-oriented mindset (based on type classes)
* Clear role within a functional architecture
